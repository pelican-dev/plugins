# Contributing

To start contributing you need to have a basic understanding of the following:

* [PHP](https://php.net) & [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) & [Filament](https://filamentphp.com)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) & [Github](https://github.com)

You can find detailed information on how plugins work in [our documentation](https://pelican.dev/docs/panel/advanced/plugins#create-a-plugin).

For information on setting up a panel dev environment, see the [contributing guide in the panel repo](https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/blob/main/contributing.md#dev-environment-setup).

## Coding Standards

We use PHPStan/[Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan) and PHP-CS-Fixer/[Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/pint) to enforce certain code styles and standards.  
You can run PHPStan via `\vendor\bin\phpstan analyse plugins` and Pint via `\vendor\bin\pint`.

## Making Contributions

From your forked repository, make your own changes on your own branch. (do not make changes directly to `main`!)  
When you are ready, you can submit a pull request to the Pelican repository. If you still work on your pull request or need help with something make sure to mark it as Draft.

If you add a new plugin, make sure to update the main README.

Also, please make sure that your pull requests are as targeted and simple as possible and don't do a hundred things at a time. If you want to add/change/fix 5 different things you should make 5 different pull requests.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Pull requests that are entirely (or mostly) generated by AI will not be accepted. If you use AI for some parts you have to clearly indicate that in the PR description.
